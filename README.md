# QuantumComputing
• Applied the observer effect, wave function collapse, and superposition using real IBM quantum computers to create a secure key and encryption/decryption algorithm

• Implemented Grover’s Algorithm to efficiently search a database in complexity O(sqrt(N)) as compared to a linear search’s complexity of O(N)

• Utilized a quantum computing algorithm to analyze recent market trends and generated an optimized stock portfolio given a choice of stocks and a budget constraint
